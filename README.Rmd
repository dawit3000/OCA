**OCA (Overload Compensation App)** is a Shiny web application designed to calculate fair instructor pay for overload teaching assignments in higher education. It applies institutional policy while offering strategic flexibility — allowing administrators to favor cost-saving, faculty retention, or a balanced approach.



# Key Features / How It Works

✨ **Upload Your Teaching Schedule**

* Provide a **.csv file** with scheduled courses, instructor names, credit hours, and enrollments.

* The file may come from:
  * Local data folder
  * URL pointing to such file
  

🔍  **Required columns (exact names):**

  * `INSTRUCTOR` — Instructor name
  * `SUBJ` — Course identifier (e.g., *MATH 1111* or *ENGL 2111-02*)
  * `HRS` — Credit hours
  * `ENRLD` — Enrollment

🔍 **Filter Courses by (Optional)**

* `SUBJ` — Subject (required column)
* `INSTRUCTOR` — Instructor (required column)
* `COLLEGE` — College (optional column, if available)
* `DEPARTMENT` — Department (optional column, if available)
* `PROGRAM` — Program (optional column, if available)

⚙️ **Set Institutional Policy Parameters**

  * Pay rate per qualified credit hour
  * Regular teaching load (in credit hours)
  * Minimum and maximum enrollment thresholds for proration
  
    👉 For institutions **without a proration policy** (full pay even for low-enrolled courses), set both **L** and **U** to `0`.


🎚 **Select a Compensation Strategy** per institutional policy

 * **Favor Institution** → prioritizes cost savings
 * **Favor Faculty** → prioritizes fairness
 * **Blend** → weighted average between the two extremes


📊 **Review Compensation Results**

* **Instructor- and institution-level pay by strategy** — with a slider to favor institution, faculty, or blended strategies in the output
* **Comparison tables and summaries** for clear side-by-side evaluation
* **Customizable output** — select only the columns you want to visualize or download, with results displayed in the desired order, e.g., : `INSTRUCTOR, SUBJ, HRS, ENRLD, QHRS, PAY, TYPE, SUMMARY`
* **SUMMARY block** — appended after instructor rows, providing payroll-ready totals with overload rate, qualified hours, and notes
* **Visual charts** to highlight compensation differences (includes institution-wide totals when charting is enabled)

# 🖥️ Output

* **Strategy-Based Comparison Tables** — detailed breakdowns of compensation with totals and summaries

  * **QHRS** — qualified credit hours used for compensation
  * **PAY** — compensation amount corresponding to `QHRS`
  * **TYPE** — indicates whether the pay is prorated (`PRO`) or full
  * **SUMMARY** — appended block with payroll-ready totals, overload rate, qualified hours, and notes
  * **Column order** — users may reorder or select only the columns they want to display or download. A typical sequence is: `INSTRUCTOR, SUBJ, HRS, ENRLD, QHRS, PAY, TYPE, SUMMARY`.
* **Strategy Comparison** — instructor- and institution-level pay under all favored strategies (Institution, Faculty, Blend) displayed side by side
* **Charts** — visualize compensation differences across strategies, including institution-wide totals when charting is enabled

# 💻 Note: 
OCA assumes a basic familiarity with faculty overload policies. For new users, future versions may include tooltips and in-app help. In the meantime, this guide provides clarifications on how proration, pay rates, and thresholds are applied within the app.
