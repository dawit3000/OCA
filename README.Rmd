# OCA: Transparent Overload Compensation App

**OCA (Overload Compensation App)** is a Shiny web application designed to calculate fair instructor pay for overload teaching assignments in higher education. It applies institutional policies and offers strategic flexibility — allowing administrators to favor cost-saving, faculty retention, or a blend of both.

## 🔑 Key Features

- Upload a teaching schedule in `.csv` format
- Filter courses by:
  - Subject
  - Instructor
  - College
  - Program
- Choose a compensation strategy using a slider:
  - **Favor Institution** (minimize pay)
  - **Favor Faculty** (maximize fairness)
  - **Blend** between the two with a user-defined weight
- Visualize instructor compensation totals across strategies
