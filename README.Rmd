# OCA: Transparent Overload Compensation App

**OCA (Overload Compensation App)** is a Shiny web application designed to calculate fair instructor pay for overload teaching assignments in higher education. It applies institutional policy while offering strategic flexibility — allowing administrators to favor cost-saving, faculty retention, or a balanced approach.

## 🔑 Key Features

- Upload a teaching schedule in `.csv` format from:
  - a local data folder, or  
  - a URL pointing to such file  
- Optionally filter courses by:
  - Subject
  - Instructor
  - College
  - Department
  - Program  
- Specify institutional compensation policies:
  - Pay rate per qualified credit hour
  - Regular teaching load (in credit hours)
  - Minimum and maximum enrollment for proration  
    - For no proration, set both L and U to 1  
- Select a compensation strategy via slider:
  - **Favor Institution** – prioritizes cost savings
  - **Favor Faculty** – prioritizes fairness
  - **Blend** – weighted average between the two extremes  
- Option to compare all strategies in the output
- Visualize compensation differences with a comparison chart
